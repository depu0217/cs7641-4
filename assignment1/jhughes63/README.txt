To run my code you must:
1) Install the standard R Distribution. I used R version 3.1.2 (2014-10-31).
2) Install R Studio or similar development environment. I used Version 0.98.1091 
3) Unzip the contents of my jhughes63.zip file into a directory of your choice (you've already done that). We'll call this your 'home' directory
4) Verify that the 'code' folder you unzipped contains 11 code files and 3 csv files. The CSV files are the data.
5) Create an output directory for the R output directly under your home directory. Name it 'output'.
6) From your home directory, open the R Studio
7) use the setwd("code") command to set your working directory to the 'code'directory you just created
8) Load the code script "LoadPackages.R" from the code directory. Run it to load the packages.
9)Load each script file from the code directory one at a time, and run it. It's easiest to do this in alphabetic order (e.g. Credit-Boost.R, Credit-KNN.R, etc.). The names are self-explanatory
10) Look in the output directory for the output from each program
